# ACLPP Instances

This project contains synthetic problem instances and benchmark solutions for the **Air Cargo Load Planning Problem** (ACLPP) described in my [thesis](https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000075507). All files are given in [YAML]-Syntax. The `masterdata` folder contains files defining the used aircraft, the considered ULD (container) types, and the separation constraints stemming from dangerous goods regulations. The folders `base`, `fast`, and `high` contain the flight files for each scenario.
